The first push went smoothly, everyone could pull then push and see name.txt
The second push on the same file didn't work as easily,
After one person pushed, we found that no one else could push. 
Each of us tried to pull the existing code, but found merge conflicts. We fixed these on at a time on one person's local, and pusehd a working version to the remote
